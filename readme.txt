This plugin finds the artists (bands, singers/songwriters, etc.), sports teams, and theatrical performances in your posts and adds a widget at the end to buy tickets to upcoming events happening near your reader.

== Description ==

This plugin takes the content you've written about artists, concerts, festivals, sports teams, and theater performances, and finds upcoming events (concerts, festivals, sports, theater, shows, musical performances) happening near your reader using Rukkus's live entertainment search engine. Rukkus pulls tickets and shows from the web's largest ticket sites, giving Rukkus a comprehensive inventory of concert listings, sporting events, and theater performances. Relevant events are listed at the bottom of your article. If no performances are found, nothing gets listed.

The plugin sends your article text to our tagging server, which analyzes the text for the presence of our 80,000 performers using modern machine learning algorithms and natural language processing techniques. We then use our live entertainment search engine's database of live events to look for upcoming performances by these performers near your reader.

This plugin is powered by https://rukkus.com, a live entertainment search engine for concerts, sports, and theater tickets.

You can see the plugin in action on the posts on http://blog.rukkus.com inside all of our articles. Note that whether you see upcoming events listings will depend on your geographic location and the performers mentioned in the article.

== Installation ==

1. Click the install button to add plugin. Alternatively, you can upload the plugin's folder to your `/wp-content/plugins/` directory. With either approach, you have the following folder '/wp-content/plugins/rukkus-content-tagger'.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. You're all done! Relevant upcoming events will appear when there are shows near your reader. Note that if no events are found, the plugin will not display.

== Frequently asked questions ==

= Where does this plugin get its events from? =

Rukkus aggregates tickets and shows from the web's largest ticket sites.

= Will the plugin be able to find performances near X location? =

By partnering with the webs largest ticketing sites, Rukkus.com  has an extremely comprehensive database of performances happening all over the world, including the United States, Canada, South America, Europe, Asia, Australia, and parts of Africa.

= Why doesn't the plugin contain performances by performer X =

We occasionally miss smaller performances. We allow artists, managers, and promoters to add their events to our platform. You may submit your performer and events to our "gigposter" here: https://rukkus.com/musicspace/performer/profile


= Why am I not seeing upcoming performances in my article? =

The plugin only shows performances near your location, which is to say that if the performers in your post are not performing near your location, no events will show up. If you believe you have found a bug, please contact us at hi@rukkus.com

= How does the plugin identify performers in the text? =

Your text is analyzed by our servers, which take our database of over 80,000 performers and hundreds of thousands of events happening throughout the world and try to tag these performers. We take privacy very seriously, and we do not store any information about your visitors or your content.
